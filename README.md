# Random Cats and Corgis

This app was built as part of a livestream with Erin Fox to introduce us to Expo and React Native.

To run this demo, youâ€™ll need to get an API key from [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true) and put it at the top of `App.js`.

Follow the [Expo getting started guide]() to get your environment set up. In the stream we had already followed the [Android emulator setup](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) and [iOS simulator setup](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/ios-simulator/) guides.
